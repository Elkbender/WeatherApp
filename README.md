Set up a kotlin/compose project.
Added splashscreen for fun.
Started using weatherApi becuase it returned the simplest response and I've used it before.
Added dependency injection even if this project isn't large enough to warrant it, in case I want to do more work on it later.
Discovered that weatherApi doesn't do lat/long searches, so I implemented METapi as well.
Added icons.
